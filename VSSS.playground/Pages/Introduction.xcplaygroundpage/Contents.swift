Hey there! Today i’m going to talk about a fairly unknown robotics competition: the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer, or VSSS! 🤖🦿⚽️

The ideia behind this category is to build a fully functional 🧠 **autonomous** 🧠 soccer team with three small robots.
 
In order to achieve that, besides the robots themselves, each team has a camera and a computer.

Each team has a camera that records the game in real time and transfers each frame to the team's computer, which will do all the image processing necessary to send movement information to the robots’ motors.
