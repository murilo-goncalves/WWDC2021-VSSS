Hey there! Today i’m going to talk about a fairly unknown robotics competition: the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer, or VSSS! 🤖🦿⚽️

The ideia behind this category is to build a fully functional 🧠 **autonomous** 🧠 soccer team with three small robots.
 
In order to achieve that, besides the robots themselves, each team has a camera and a computer.

The camera records the game in real time and transfers the image to the computer, which will do all the image processing necessary to send movement information to the robots’ motors.
