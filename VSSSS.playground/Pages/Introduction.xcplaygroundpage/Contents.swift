# What's VSSS?
 
 ![Real life VSSS match](real_life.png "Real life VSSS match")
 
Hey there WWDC! Today i‚Äôm going to talk about a fairly unknown robotics competition: the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer, or VSSS! ‚öΩÔ∏èü§ñ

The ideia behind this category is to build a fully functional **autonomous** üß† soccer team with three small robots.
 
In order to achieve that, besides the robots themselves, teams have to use a camera and a computer. The camera records the game in real time and transfers each frame image to the team's computer, which will do all the image processing and computer vision necessary to send movement information to the robots‚Äô motors.
 
Beyond the robotics control and computer vision, that are already a challenge, the real fun part of this category is to come up with new and strong strategies, that range from simple conditional movement (as shown in the next page) to artificial potential fields and machine learning algorithms!
 
As an entry robotics category, the VSSS is a powerful incentive to those starting in the robotics and AI fields. It's an affordable project and anyone with few resources can start to build a team!
